### React.StrictMode

Activates additional checks and warnings , works only in development not in production

Runs twice in development mode

### App.css

Whatever logic is added to app.css will be added after index.css (It overrides the index.css)

Basically Its not scope to certain components

### Why Vite ?

(Vite)[https://vitejs.dev/]

```sh
npm create vite@latest app-name -- --template react
npm install
npm run dev

```

http://localhost:5173/

### Vite Setup

need to use .jsx extension(which is optional in normal react)

index.html in the source instead of public

assets still in public

instead of index.js, need to use main.jsx

to spin up dev server - "npm run dev"

rest the same - imports/exports, deployment, assets, etc...

### Advanced React
